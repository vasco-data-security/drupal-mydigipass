# Drupal-mydigipass

Drupal plugin to add MYDIGIPASS.COM Secure two factor authentication to your drupal site.

All enhancement proposals can be submitted to our github and will be considered to become part of the official code base.

The MYDIGIPASS.COM Development team.


# Installing the plugin

This is an official [drupal project](http://drupal.org/project/mydigipass). We also have a [demo-site](http://mdpdemo.dev.vanstechelman.com/demo) that clearly shows 
the use of MYDIGIPASS.COM in drupal.

Hope this helps.
